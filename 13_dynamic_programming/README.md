    """Basic linear DP - number of ways to reach step n"""
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    
    # Bottom-up approach
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):

    # Modify input array (or create new dp array)
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue
            elif i == 0:

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    """Minimum coins to make amount (Unbounded Knapsack)"""
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

def knapsack_01(weights, values, capacity):
    """0/1 Knapsack - each item can be used once"""
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    dp[i-1][w],  # Don't take item
                    dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]] + values[i-1]  # Take item
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    
    return dp[n][capacity]
```

### **Pattern 5: Subsequence DP**
```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    """Length of LIS"""
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)

def lis_optimized(nums):
    """LIS with O(n log n) using binary search"""
    from bisect import bisect_left
    
    tails = []
    
    for num in nums:
        pos = bisect_left(tails, num)
        if pos == len(tails):
            tails.append(num)

## üìä **DP Pattern Classification**

| Pattern | Examples | Recurrence Type | Optimization |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Linear DP** | Fibonacci, House Robber | dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) | Space: O(n) ‚Üí O(1) |
| **Grid DP** | Unique Paths, Min Path Sum | dp[i][j] = f(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) | Space: O(m*n) ‚Üí O(n) |
| **String DP** | LCS, Edit Distance | dp[i][j] = f(s1[i], s2[j]) | Often 2D |
| **Knapsack DP** | Coin Change, 0/1 Knapsack | Include/Exclude decisions | Space optimization possible |
| **Interval DP** | Palindrome, Matrix Chain | dp[i][j] = optimal for range [i,j] | Usually O(n¬≥) |

## üß† **Key Insights**

### **DP Problem Identification**
1. **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal subsolutions
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Same subproblems solved multiple times
3. **Decision at each step**: Choose between options
4. **Optimization goal**: Minimize/maximize some value

### **Top-Down vs Bottom-Up**
- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Recursive + cache, easier to think
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Iterative, often more space efficient

### **State Design Strategy**
- **What information do I need**: To make optimal decision at each step
- **State transition**: How current state relates to previous states
- **Base cases**: Simple cases where answer is known

## üí° **Interview Tips**

### **üó£Ô∏è Communication Strategy**
1. **Identify DP**: "This has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems"
2. **Define state**: "dp[i] represents the optimal solution for first i elements"
3. **Explain transition**: "For each element, we can either include it or exclude it"

### **‚ö° Optimization Techniques**
- **Space optimization**: Reduce dimensions when only previous values needed
- **Memoization**: Add caching to recursive solution
- **State compression**: Use bit manipulation for subset problems

### **üêõ Common Pitfalls**
- **Wrong state definition**: Not capturing enough information
- **Incorrect base cases**: Edge cases not handled properly
- **Index errors**: Off-by-one in array access
- **Infinite recursion**: No proper base case in memoization

## üîç **Problem Identification**

**Use DP when you see:**
- "Find optimal solution" (min/max)
- "Count number of ways"
- "Is it possible to..." 
- Problems with choices at each step
- Recursive solution with overlapping subproblems

## üìà **Complexity Patterns**

| DP Type | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Space Optimized |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **1D Linear** | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) |
| **2D Grid** | O(m*n) | O(m*n) | O(min(m,n)) |
| **String (2D)** | O(m*n) | O(m*n) | O(min(m,n)) |
| **Knapsack** | O(n*W) | O(n*W) | O(W) |
| **Interval** | O(n¬≥) | O(n¬≤) | Usually not optimizable |

## üéØ **DP Development Process**

### **Step-by-Step Approach**
1. **Recognize DP**: Optimal substructure + overlapping subproblems
2. **Define state**: What does dp[i] represent?
3. **State transition**: How to compute dp[i] from previous states?
4. **Base cases**: What are the simplest cases?
5. **Implementation**: Top-down (recursion + memo) or bottom-up (tabulation)
6. **Optimization**: Can we reduce space complexity?

### **Common State Definitions**
- **dp[i]**: Optimal solution for first i elements
- **dp[i][j]**: Optimal solution for subproblem ending at (i,j)
- **dp[i][j][k]**: 3D problems with additional constraint k
