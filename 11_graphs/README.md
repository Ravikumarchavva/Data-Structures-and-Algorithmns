## üìä **Graph Algorithm Comparison**

| Algorithm | Use Case | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **DFS** | Path finding, connectivity | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| **BFS** | Shortest path (unweighted) | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| **Topological Sort** | Dependency ordering | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| **Connected Components** | Graph analysis | O(V + E) | O(V) |
| **Cycle Detection** | Validation | O(V + E) | O(V) |

## üß† **Key Insights**

### **DFS vs BFS Usage**
- **DFS**: Path existence, connected components, cycle detection
- **BFS**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-by-level processing

### **Graph Representation Choice**
- **Adjacency List**: Best for sparse graphs, O(V + E) space
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Better for dense graphs, O(V¬≤) space
- **Edge List**: Simple representation, O(E) space

### **Grid as Graph**
- **Cells as vertices**: Each cell is a node
- **Adjacent cells as edges**: 4-directional or 8-directional
- **Apply standard graph algorithms**: BFS/DFS work directly

## üí° **Interview Tips**

### **üó£Ô∏è Communication Strategy**
1. **Clarify graph type**: "Is this directed or undirected?"
2. **Discuss representation**: "I'll use adjacency list for efficiency"
3. **Explain algorithm choice**: "BFS gives shortest path in unweighted graphs"

### **‚ö° Optimization Techniques**
- **Early termination**: Stop when target found
- **Bidirectional search**: Search from both ends
- **Visited set**: Avoid revisiting nodes

### **üêõ Common Pitfalls**
- **Not handling disconnected graphs**: Check all components
- **Infinite loops**: Ensure proper visited tracking
- **Wrong graph representation**: Directed vs undirected
- **Boundary conditions**: Grid problems need bounds checking

## üîç **Problem Identification**

**Use Graph algorithms when you see:**
- "Connected components"
- "Shortest path"
- "Dependencies" or "prerequisites"
- "Islands" or "regions"
- "Network" or "relationships"
- 2D grid traversal problems

## üìà **Complexity Patterns**

| Graph Type | Vertices (V) | Edges (E) | Typical Complexity |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Sparse** | n | O(n) | O(V + E) = O(n) |
| **Dense** | n | O(n¬≤) | O(V + E) = O(n¬≤) |
| **Grid** | m√ón | ~4√óm√ón | O(m√ón) |
| **Tree** | n | n-1 | O(n) |
