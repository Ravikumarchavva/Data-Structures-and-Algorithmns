## üß† **Advanced Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Shortest Path Variants**
```python
def shortest_path_with_constraints(graph, start, end, max_stops):
    """Shortest path with maximum stops constraint"""
    # Use BFS with level tracking
    queue = deque([(start, 0, 0)])  # (node, cost, stops)
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    while queue:
        node, cost, stops = queue.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
            continue
        
        if stops < max_stops:
            for neighbor, weight in graph.get(node, []):
                if cost + weight < min_cost:  # Pruning
                    queue.append((neighbor, cost + weight, stops + 1))
    
    return min_cost if min_cost != float('inf') else -1

def shortest_path_visiting_all(graph, must_visit):
    """Shortest path visiting all required nodes (TSP variant)"""
    n = len(must_visit)
    dp = {}
    
    def tsp(mask, pos):
        if mask == (1 << n) - 1:  # Visited all nodes
            return 0
        
        if (mask, pos) in dp:
            return dp[(mask, pos)]
        
        result = float('inf')
        for next_pos in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << next_pos)):  # Not visited
                new_mask = mask | (1 << next_pos)
                cost = graph[must_visit[pos]][must_visit[next_pos]]
                result = min(result, cost + tsp(new_mask, next_pos))
        
        dp[(mask, pos)] = result
        return result
    
    # Try starting from each node
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for start in range(n):
        cost = tsp(1 << start, start)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

### **Pattern 2: Graph Modification Problems**
```python
def min_edges_to_make_connected(n, connections):
    """LC 1319: Number of Operations to Make Network Connected"""
    if len(connections) < n - 1:
        return -1  # Not enough edges
    
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    redundant_edges = 0
    
    for u, v in connections:
        if not uf.union(u, v):
            redundant_edges += 1
    
    components = uf.get_components_count()
    return components - 1  # Need (components - 1) additional edges

def swim_in_rising_water(grid):
    """LC 778: Swim in Rising Water"""
    n = len(grid)
    
    def can_reach(max_height):
        if grid[0][0] > max_height:
            return False
        
        visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        stack = [(0, 0)]
        visited[0][0] = True
        
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        
        while stack:
            row, col = stack.pop()
            
            if row == n - 1 and col == n - 1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and 
                    not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] <= max_height):
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    stack.append((nr, nc))
        
        return False
    
    # Binary search on the answer
    left, right = max(grid[0][0], grid[n-1][n-1]), max(max(row) for row in grid)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_reach(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left
```

## üí° **Interview Tips**

### **üó£Ô∏è Communication Strategy**
1. **Identify the problem type**: "This looks like a shortest path problem"
2. **Choose appropriate algorithm**: "Since we have non-negative weights, Dijkstra is optimal"
3. **Discuss time/space tradeoffs**: "Floyd-Warshall gives us all-pairs but uses O(V¬≤) space"

### **‚ö° Algorithm Selection Guide**
- **Single-source shortest path**: Dijkstra (non-negative), Bellman-Ford (negative weights)
- **All-pairs shortest path**: Floyd-Warshall
- **Minimum spanning tree**: Kruskal (sparse), Prim (dense)
- **Cycle detection**: Union-Find, DFS
- **Topological ordering**: Kahn's algorithm, DFS

### **üêõ Common Pitfalls**
- **Negative weight cycles**: Use Bellman-Ford, not Dijkstra
- **Graph representation**: Choose adjacency list vs matrix wisely
- **Union-Find optimization**: Always use path compression and union by rank
- **MST uniqueness**: Multiple MSTs can exist with same total weight

## üîç **Problem Identification**

**Use Advanced Graph Algorithms when you see:**
- "Shortest path between..."
- "Minimum cost to connect..."
- "Network connectivity"
- "Critical connections/bridges"
- "Strongly connected components"
- "Course dependencies" (topological sort)
- "Union of accounts/groups"
