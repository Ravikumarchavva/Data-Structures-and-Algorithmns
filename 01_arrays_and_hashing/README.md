## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Patterns & Templates**

### **Pattern 1: Frequency Counting**
```python
def frequency_pattern(arr):
    freq = {}
    for item in arr:
        freq[item] = freq.get(item, 0) + 1
    return freq

# Example: Find most frequent element
def most_frequent(arr):
    freq = frequency_pattern(arr)
    return max(freq, key=freq.get)
```

### **Pattern 2: Hash Map Lookup** 
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}  # value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

### **Pattern 3: Set for Duplicates**
```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    seen = set()
    for item in arr:
        if item in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(item)
    return False
```

### **Pattern 4: Array as Hash (Limited Range)**
```python
def counting_sort_approach(arr, max_val):
    # When array values are in range [0, max_val]
    count = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for num in arr:
        count[num] += 1
    return count
```

## üìä **Complexity Analysis**

| Operation | Array | Hash Map | Set |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----|
| **Access** | O(1) | O(1) avg | N/A |
| **Search** | O(n) | O(1) avg | O(1) avg |
| **Insert** | O(n) | O(1) avg | O(1) avg |
| **Delete** | O(n) | O(1) avg | O(1) avg |
| **Space** | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |

## üß† **Key Insights**

### **When to Use Hash Maps**
- Need O(1) lookup time
- Frequency counting problems  
- Complement searching (Two Sum pattern)
- Grouping by criteria (anagrams)

### **When to Use Sets**
- Duplicate detection
- Membership testing
- Mathematical set operations

### **When to Use Arrays**
- Index-based access needed
- Limited range of values (counting sort)
- Space optimization important

## üí° **Interview Tips**

### **üó£Ô∏è Communication Strategy**
1. **Clarify constraints**: "What's the range of values?"
2. **Discuss trade-offs**: "HashMap uses O(n) space for O(1) lookups"
3. **Mention alternatives**: "Could also sort first, but that's O(n log n)"

### **‚ö° Optimization Techniques**
- **Space optimization**: Use array instead of HashMap for limited ranges
- **Early termination**: Return immediately when condition met
- **In-place operations**: Modify input array when allowed

### **üêõ Common Pitfalls**
- Hash collisions in worst case ‚Üí O(n) operations
- Integer overflow in sum problems
- Modifying collection while iterating
- Not handling edge cases (empty arrays)

## üîç **Problem Identification**

**Use Arrays & Hashing when you see:**
- "Find duplicates"
- "Count frequency"  
- "Group by criteria"
- "Two/Three/Four Sum"
- "Anagram problems"
- "Subarray with given sum"
